# fracture toughness


## fracture toughness

-   The critical load at which a cracked specimen fails produces a critical stress intensity factor
-   The "critical stress intensity factor" is known as *K*<sub>*c*</sub>
-   For Mode I, this is called *K*<sub>*Ic*</sub>
-   The critical stress intensity factor is also known as fracture toughness
 
\\[K_{IC} = \sigma_c \sqrt{\pi a}\beta\\]

-   Note: "Fracture Toughness" can also refer to *G*<sub>*Ic*</sub>, which is analogous to *K*<sub>*Ic*</sub>, but not the same


## fracture toughness

-   Fracture toughness is a material property, but it is only well-defined in certain conditions
-   Brittle materials
-   Plane strain (smaller plastic zone)
-   In these cases ASTM E399-12 is used.


## fracture toughness

![Thin panels have a generally higher fracture toughness, as they are in plane stress. As the panel gets thicker it converges to the plane strain fracture toughness.](../images/KIC_thickness.jpg) <!-- .element width="50%" -->


## unstable cracks

-   Stable crack growth means the crack extends only with increased load
-   Unstable crack growth means the crack will continue to extend indefinitely under the same load
-   For a perfectly brittle material, there is no stable crack growth, as soon as a critical load is reached, the crack will extend indefinitely


## stable cracks

-   For an elastic-plastic material, once the load is large enough to extend the crack, it will extend slightly
-   The load must be continually increased until a critical value causes unstable crack growth


## fracture toughness

-   During an experiment, we will record the crack length and applied load (*P*<sub>*i*</sub>, *a*<sub>*i*</sub>) each time we increase the load
-   We can calculate a unique stress intensity factor *K*<sub>*Ii*</sub> at each of these points
-   These are then used to create a "K-curve", plotting *K*<sub>*I*</sub> vs. *a*


## K-curve

![A graph showing the fracture toughness of a perfectly brittle material vs. a ductile material. A perfectly brittle material will not have any crack growth until the stress intensity is K_IC, at which point the crack grows indefinitely. A ductile material will have mostly stable crack growth, until reaching a critical value, K_C.](../images/k-curve.PNG) <!-- .element width="60%" -->


## K-curve

-   Materials will generally not be as flat as the perfectly brittle example
-   Plane strain conditions and brittle materials will tend towards a "flat" K-curve
-   *K*<sub>*IC*</sub> for brittle/plane strain is very well defined
-   *K*<sub>*C*</sub> for plane stress can refer to two things
-   Either the maximum *K*<sub>*C*</sub> during a test, or tangent point on *K*<sub>*R*</sub>-curve (R-curve)


## example

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
-  In composites, and adhesives, some work is needed to ensure stable crack growth
-  The Double-Cantilever Beam (DCB) experiment to find *G*<sub>*IC*</sub> illustrates this

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
\\[\begin{aligned}
  C &= \frac{\delta}{P}\\
  C &= \frac{2a^3}{3EI}\\
  G &= \frac{P^2}{2b}\frac{dC}{da}\\
  G &= \frac{P^2a^2}{bEI}
\end{aligned}\\]

:::
::::::::::::::

## example

-   For crack growth to be stable we need

\\[\frac{dG}{da} \le 0\\]

-   Under fixed-load conditions, we find

\\[\frac{dG}{da} = \frac{2P^2a}{bEI}\\]

-   This is always positive, and thus results in unstable crack growth


## example

-   Under fixed-displacement conditions, we substitute for *P*
-   We find

\\[\frac{dG}{da} = -\frac{9\delta^2EI}{ba^3}\\]

-   Which is always stable, so for DCB tests, displacement control is generally used

## ASTM E399

1.  Select specimen size
2.  Select specimen type (Compact Tension or Single Edge Notched Bend)

## ASTM E399

<ol start="3">
  <li>Machine specimen</li>
  <li>Fatigue crack specimen K<sub>f</sub> &lt; 0.6K<sub>IC</sub></li>
  <ul>
    <li>This is to ensure that the plastic zone size during fatigue is smaller than the plastic zone size during testing</li>
    <li>If K<sub>IC</sub> has not yet been determined, you may have to guess the first time</li>
  </ul>
</ol>


## ASTM E399

<ol start="5">
  <li>Mount specimen, attach gage</li>
  <li>Load rate should ensure "static" load conditions. (30 - 150 ksi $\sqrt{\text{in.}}$ /min.)</li>
  <li>Determine the "provisional" value of K<sub>IC</sub> (known as K<sub>Q</sub>)</li>
</ol>


## ASTM E399

![Various different conditions for how the provisional K_IC value is to be found.](../images/astm-e399.PNG) <!-- .element width="70%" -->


## ASTM E399

- If the load-displacement curve is like the first figure, with some non-linearity, we let *P*<sub>*Q*</sub> be the point of intersection between the load-displacement curve and a line whose slope is 5% lower than the slope in the elastic region
- "Pop-in" occurs when there is stable crack extension before the plasticity begins. We let *P*<sub>*Q*</sub> bet the point where stable crack extension begins.


## ASTM E399

- For a perfectly linear material, *P*<sub>*Q*</sub> = *P*<sub>*max*</sub>.

\\[\begin{aligned}
  K_Q &= \frac{P_Q}{BW^{1/2}}f\left(\frac{a}{W}\right) & \text{Compact Tension}\\
  K_Q &= \frac{P_Q}{BW^{3/2}}g\left(\frac{a}{W}\right) & \text{SENB}
\end{aligned}\\]


## ASTM E399

<ol start="8">
<li>Ensure that your specimen is still valid

\\[\begin{aligned}
    a & \ge 2.5 \left(\frac{K_Q}{\sigma_{YS}}\right)^2\\
    b & \ge 2.5 \left(\frac{K_Q}{\sigma_{YS}}\right)^2\\
    W & \ge 5 \left(\frac{K_Q}{\sigma_{YS}}\right)^2
\end{aligned}\\]

</li>
</ol>


## ASTM E399

-   For stable crack extension, check the *P*<sub>*max*</sub>

\\[\frac{P_{max}}{P_Q} \le 1.10\\]

-   Check for symmetric crack front, *a*<sub>1</sub>, *a*<sub>2</sub>, and *a*<sub>3</sub> must be within 5% of *a*. *a*<sub>*s*</sub> must be within 10% of *a*.

\\[\frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3}{3} = a\\]

-   Load-displacement should have an initial slope between 0.7 and 1.5

## R-curve

-   For materials with some plasticity, the *K*<sub>*R*</sub> Curve, or R Curve, is very important
-   Sometimes called a "resistance curve" it is generally dependent on
    -   Thickness
    -   Temperature
    -   Strain rate


## R-curve

-   When done correctly, *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curves are not dependent on initial crack size or the specimen type used
-   ASTM E561 describes a general procedure


## ASTM E561

-   Compact Tension (CT or C(T)) specimens may be used for plane stress *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curves
-   The other specimen which is permitted is a middle-cracked tension specimen (M(T))
-   M(T) specimens are preferred in many cases due to a more uniform stress distribution (particularly important for anisotropic materials)

## effective crack length

-   ASTM E561 describes three ways to obtain the effective crack length during testing
    1.  Measure the crack length visually and calculate *r*<sub>*p*</sub>
    2.  Measure crack length using "unloading compliance" and adding plastic zone size
    3.  Measure the effective crack size directly using "secant compliance"


## secant compliance

![A force-displacement curve with secant lines (i.e. average slope) superposed at various locations.](../images/secant.PNG) <!-- .element width="40%" -->


## secant compliance M(T)

-   Using the slope data from our load-displacement curve, we can calculate the effective crack length using

\\[\begin{gathered}
  EB\left(\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta P}\right) = \frac{2 Y}{W} \sqrt{\frac{\pi a / W}{\sin (\pi a / W)}} \\
  \qquad \left[\frac{2W}{\pi Y} \cosh^{-1} \left(\frac{\cosh(\pi Y/W)}{\cos (\pi a / W)}\right) - \frac{1+\nu}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{\sin(\pi a/W)}{\sinh (\pi Y/W)}\right)^2}}+\nu\right]
\end{gathered}\\]


## secant compliance M(T)

-   This equation is difficult to solve directly for *a* (for M(T) specimens)
-   Instead it is generally solved iteratively
-   The following equations are used to give a good initial guess to use in iterations


## secant compliance M(T)

\\[\begin{aligned}
  X &= 1 - \exp \left[\frac{-\sqrt{[EB(\Delta v/ \Delta P)]^2 - (2Y/W)^2}}{2.141}\right]\\
  &\begin{aligned}
  \frac{2a}{W} &= 1.2235X - 0.699032X^2 + 3.25584X^3 - 6.65042X^4 + \\
  &\qquad 5.54X^5 - 1.66989X^6
  \end{aligned}
\end{aligned}\\]

  In the above equations, the following are the definitions of parameters used

::: {.column width="50%"}
\\[\begin{aligned}
  E &= \qquad \text{Young's Modulus}\\
  \Delta v / \Delta P &= \qquad \text{specimen compliance}\\
  B &= \qquad \text{specimen thickness}\\
  W &= \qquad \text{specimen width}\\
  Y &= \qquad \text{half span}\\
  a &= \qquad \text{effective crack length}\\
  \nu &= \qquad \text{Poisson's ratio}
\end{aligned}\\]

:::
::::::::::::::

## secant compliance C(T)

-   For C(T) specimens, we use the following equations

\\[EB\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta P} = A_0 + A_1\left(\frac{a}{W}\right) + A_2\left(\frac{a}{W}\right)^2 + A_3\left(\frac{a}{W}\right)^3 + A_4\left(\frac{a}{W}\right)^4\\]

-   The coefficients will differ based on where the displacement is measured from

## secant compliance C(T)

-   Where the initial guess for *a* is provided by

\\[\frac{a}{W} = C_0 + C_1 U + C_2 U^2 + C_3 U^3 + C_4 U^4 + C_5 U^5\\]

-   and *U* is given by

\\[U = \frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{EB\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta P}}}\\]


## buckling

-   If the test is stopped and re-started frequently (to measure crack length by hand or to use the compliance method of crack measurement) buckling can interfere with results


## buckling

![Load-displacement curve after unloading and reloading, showing how this can interfere with results](../images/buckling.PNG) <!-- .element width="40%" -->


## buckling

-   If buckling is shown to be present in the test, supports can be used to prevent buckling
-   These supports can introduce friction
-   They should be well-lubricated for accurate test results


## net section stress

-   One final consideration when dealing with plane stress fracture mechanics is the net section stress
-   For the test to be valid, failure must occur due to fracture, not general static failure
-   Static failure will occur when \\(\sigma_N = \sigma_{YS}\\)


## generate *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curve

-   Once the effective crack length and *K*<sub>*Ie*</sub> has been determined for the test, we can generate the *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curve
-   The *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curve is quite simply a plot of *K*<sub>*Ie*</sub> vs. *a* for the test performed (i.e. with varying stress and increasing crack length)


## initial crack length

-   When the test is performed correctly, the *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curve is not a function of the initial crack length
-   For this reason, we often plot *K*<sub>*Ie*</sub> vs. $\Delta a$, to subtract the initial crack length
-   We can superpose constant-stress *K*-curves on this graph, the curve which intersects at a tangent point creates the most "standard" definition for *K*<sub>*C*</sub>
