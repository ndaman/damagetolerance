# fracture toughness

----
## fracture toughness

-   The critical load at which a cracked specimen fails produces a critical stress intensity factor
-   The "critical stress intensity factor" is known as *K*<sub>*c*</sub>
-   For Mode I, this is called *K*<sub>*Ic*</sub>
-   The critical stress intensity factor is also known as fracture toughness
$$K\_{IC} = \\sigma\_c \\sqrt{\\pi a}\\beta$$
-   Note: "Fracture Toughness" can also refer to *G*<sub>*Ic*</sub>, which is analogous to *K*<sub>*Ic*</sub>, but not the same

----
## fracture toughness

-   Fracture toughness is a material property, but it is only well-defined in certain conditions
-   Brittle materials
-   Plane strain (smaller plastic zone)
-   In these cases ASTM E399-12 is used.

----
## fracture toughness

![Thin panels have a generally higher fracture toughness, as they are in plane stress. As the panel gets thicker it converges to the plane strain fracture toughness.](images\KIC_thickness.jpg) <!-- .element width="50%" -->

----
## unstable cracks

-   Stable crack growth means the crack extends only with increased load
-   Unstable crack growth means the crack will continue to extend indefinitely under the same load
-   For a perfectly brittle material, there is no stable crack growth, as soon as a critical load is reached, the crack will extend indefinitely

----
## stable cracks
-   For an elastic-plastic material, once the load is large enough to extend the crack, it will extend slightly
-   The load must be continually increased until a critical value causes unstable crack growth

----
## fracture toughness

-   During an experiment, we will record the crack length and applied load (*P*<sub>*i*</sub>, *a*<sub>*i*</sub>) each time we increase the load
-   We can calculate a unique stress intensity factor *K*<sub>*Ii*</sub> at each of these points
-   These are then used to create a "K-curve", plotting *K*<sub>*I*</sub> vs. *a*

----
## K-curve

![A graph showing the fracture toughness of a perfectly brittle material vs. a ductile material. A perfectly brittle material will not have any crack growth until the stress intensity is K_IC, at which point the crack grows indefinitely. A ductile material will have mostly stable crack growth, until reaching a critical value, K_C.](images\k-curve.PNG) <!-- .element width="60%" -->

----
## K-curve

-   Materials will generally not be as flat as the perfectly brittle example
-   Plane strain conditions and brittle materials will tend towards a "flat" K-curve
-   *K*<sub>*IC*</sub> for brittle/plane strain is very well defined
-   *K*<sub>*C*</sub> for plane stress can refer to two things
-   Either the maximum *K*<sub>*C*</sub> during a test, or tangent point on *K*<sub>*R*</sub>-curve (R-curve)

----
## example

<div class="left">
<ul>
  <li>In composites, and adhesives, some work is needed to ensure stable crack growth</li>
  <li>The Double-Cantilever Beam (DCB) experiment to find *G*<sub>*IC*</sub> illustrates this</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="right">
$$\\begin{aligned}
  C &= \\frac{\\delta}{P}\\\\
  C &= \\frac{2a^3}{3EI}\\\\
  G &= \\frac{P^2}{2b}\\frac{dC}{da}\\\\
  G &= \\frac{P^2a^2}{bEI}
\\end{aligned}$$
</div>

----
## example

-   For crack growth to be stable we need
$$\\frac{dG}{da} \\le 0$$
-   Under fixed-load conditions, we find
$$\\frac{dG}{da} = \\frac{2P^2a}{bEI}$$
-   This is always positive, and thus results in unstable crack growth

----
## example

-   Under fixed-displacement conditions, we substitute for *P*
-   We find
$$\\frac{dG}{da} = -\\frac{9\\delta^2EI}{ba^3}$$
-   Which is always stable, so for DCB tests, displacement control is generally used

---
# R-curve

----
## R-curve

-   For materials with some plasticity, the *K*<sub>*R*</sub> Curve, or R Curve, is very important
-   Sometimes called a "resistance curve" it is generally dependent on
    -   Thickness
    -   Temperature
    -   Strain rate

----
## R-curve

-   When done correctly, *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curves are not dependent on initial crack size or the specimen type used
-   ASTM E561 describes a general procedure

----
## *K*<sub>*c*</sub>

-   While we can look up plane stress *K*<sub>*c*</sub> for various materials, it is best if we have a *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curve
-   We may not know if the table uses *K*<sub>*c*</sub> using the tangent intersection method, or maximum stress intensity
-   Even if tangent intersection method is used, *K*<sub>*c*</sub> will different somewhat based on initial crack length

----
## R-curve

-   There are two main methods for plotting the R-curve
-   Crack size is measured directly (possibly with a drawn-on scale and camera)
-   Effective crack size is calculated from the load-displacement data

----
## physical crack

-   When the physical crack size is measured, we need to calculate the effective crack length (and effective stress intensity factor) at each data point
-   The effective crack length calculated from the load-displacement data already has the plastic zone effect built in

----
## plane stress fracture toughness

-   For a plane stress (or any thickness that is not plane strain) we can find *K*<sub>*c*</sub> two ways
-   One way is simply the maximum value of the *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curve, but this does not account for unstable crack growth
-   The more reliable way is to use the tangent intersection method

----
## tangent intersection method

-   Construct curves for *K*<sub>*I*</sub> based on our specimen geometry with constant applied load and varying crack length
-   Plot these curves on the same graph as *K*<sub>*R*</sub>
-   NOTE: *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curve should be plotted vs. *a*<sub>*eff*</sub>, not `$\Delta a$` or `$\Delta a_{eff}$`
-   *K*<sub>*c*</sub> is the point at which one of the *K*<sub>*I*</sub> curves is the tangent intersection with the *K*<sub>*R*</sub> curve

# thickness effects

----
## thickness effects

-   We already know there is a difference between plane strain and plane stress fracture toughness
-   As a material gets thicker and thicker, it converges to the plane strain solution
-   Thinner specimens tend towards the plane stress solution
-   When a specimen is thinner than some critical thickness, the material behavior is somewhat unknown

----
## thickness effects

-   There is also a difference in the fracture surface between thin and thick specimens
-   Thin specimens (in plane stress region) fail due to slant fracture
-   This actually indicates some mixed-mode conditions at failure
-   Thick specimens fail due to square fracture (with a small shear tip near the edges)
-   This is more consistent with pure Mode I

----

# residual strength

----
## residual strength

-   As the crack grows, the area of the sample decreases, increasing the net section stress
-   The residual strength, `$\sigma_R$` is given in terms of the gross area, so as the crack grows the residual strength due to yield decreases
-   We can relate the net-section stress to `$\sigma_R$` by
$$\\sigma\_R = \\sigma\_{YS} \\frac{A\_{net}}{A\_{gross}}$$

----
## residual strength

![Effective yield strength plotted vs. crack length. As the crack gets longer, the actual cross-sectional area decreases so that the effective yield strength also goes down.](images\residual-strength.PNG) <!-- .element width="60%" -->

----
## residual strength

-   For brittle fracture to occur, we need to satisfy the condition
$$\\sigma\_R = \\sigma\_C = \\frac{K\_C}{\\sqrt{\\pi a}\\beta}$$

----
## residual strength

![Here the effective K_i is plotted vs. crack length and compared to the net section yield. The lower of the two values will cause failure.](images\residual-tough.PNG) <!-- .element width="60%" -->

----
## residual strength

-   Within the same family of materials (i.e. Aluminum), there is generally a trade-off between yield stress and fracture toughness
-   As we increase the yield strength, we decrease the fracture toughness (and vice versa)
-   Consider a comparison of the following aluminum alloys
    1.  7178-T6, $K\_C = 43 \\text{ ksi} \\sqrt{\\text{in.}}$, `$\sigma_{YS} = 74$` ksi
    2.  7075-T6, $K\_C = 68 \\text{ ksi} \\sqrt{\\text{in.}}$, `$\sigma_{YS} = 63$` ksi
    3.  2024-T3, $K\_C = 144 \\text{ ksi} \\sqrt{\\text{in.}}$, `$\sigma_{YS} = 42$` ksi

----
## residual strength

-   As an example let us consider an edge-cracked panel with $W=6"$ and $t=0.1"$
-   The net section yield condition will be given by
$$\\sigma\_C = \\sigma\_{YS} \\frac{W-a}{W} = \\sigma\_{YS}\\frac{6-a}{6}$$
-   And the fracture condition by
$$\\sigma\_C = \\frac{K\_C}{\\sqrt{\\pi a} \\beta}$$
     With
$$\\small\{\\beta = 1.12 - 0.231\\left(\\frac{a}{W}\\right) + 10.55 \\left(\\frac{a}{W}\\right)^2 - 21.72 \\left(\\frac{a}{W}\\right)^3 + 30.39 \\left(\\frac{a}{W}\\right)^4\}$$
