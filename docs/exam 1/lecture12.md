## exam format

-   Look at the exam and equation sheet posted on Blackboard
-   Expect a mixture of quantitative and qualitative questions (some short answer justifications)
-   5 questions (current plan)
-   I curve all my exams linearly
-   Pay attention to what the question is asking for and be sure to answer all parts of the question
-   There will be no T/F section, but those questions in the text can still be useful for review

----
## equation sheet

-   The equation sheet for this exam will be the same as the previous equation sheet posted to Blackboard
-   Other specific information and formulas (mixed-mode fracture, stiffener data, etc.) will be given in the problem
