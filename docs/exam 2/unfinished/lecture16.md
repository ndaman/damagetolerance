final project
=============

<span>general description</span>

-   This is in place of a final exam

-   Should demonstrate your understanding of the course as a whole

-   Choose any real object

-   Needs to undergo some cyclic loading (for fatigue)

-   Materials, loads, and any other “given” data can be made up

<span>overview</span>

-   Estimate stress intensity factor at some critical location

-   Estimate residual strength (use a “typical” crack length)

-   Estimate fatigue life and crack propagation

-   Suggest reasonable inspection cycle for safe use

-   Suggest an improvement to make part more damage tolerant

<span>grade breakdown</span>

-   Per course syllabus, project will be worth 25% of final grade

-   5% Project abstract submission and approval

-   15% for each major component

    -   stress intensity factor

    -   residual strength

    -   fatigue

    -   crack propagation

    -   inspection cycle

-   10% for damage tolerant improvement

-   10% general presentation, organization, and grammar

<span>project abstract</span>

-   Main purpose of abstract is for you to make sure your idea fits with project purpose

-   I will give you feedback on how to tweak your proposed idea to better meet project purpose

-   Abstract submission should be 1-2 pages

-   Briefly describe your chosen part, how it undergoes cyclic loading, what location you intend to consider for the stress intensity factor.

-   This is like a proposal: convince me that your idea has what it takes to be a great final project

<span>justify assumptions</span>

-   You will need to make many assumptions in order to complete this project

-   Clearly state your assumptions and justify them (i.e. if you assume plane strain conditions, justify that by showing how thick your part is)

-   Although will not have experimental or FE analysis specific to your part, use concepts from other data in the text (stiffeners, multiple site damage) in a qualitative manner

<span>figures</span>

-   Figures can greatly enhance your project report, if you use them well

-   Many readers will jump to figures in a report, include sufficient information in caption and axis labels so a reader with general damage tolerance understanding can understand your figure

-   This will interest them in the rest of your paper

<span>examples</span>

-   Last year I did not curve final project grades

-   Some examples of a couple of excellent project reports have been posted to blackboard

-   You should not use their projects, but they have very good use of figures, as well as an appropriate balance of both depth and breadth in the their analysis
