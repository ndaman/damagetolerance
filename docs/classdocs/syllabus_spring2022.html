<h2 id="how-to-use-this-syllabus">How to use this syllabus:</h2>
<p>This syllabus provides you with information specific to this course, and it also provides information about important university policies. This document should be viewed as a course overview; it is not a contract and is subject to change as the semester evolves. Any changes to the syllabus will be uploaded to Blackboard and e-mailed to all students (at their e-mail address listed on Blackboard, make sure this is up-to-date). Many University policies are summarized in this document, but a more up-to-date and complete list of University policies can be found at <a href="https://www.wichita.edu/faculty/development/syllabuspolicies.php">https://www.wichita.edu/faculty/development/syllabuspolicies.php</a></p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity:</h2>
<p>Students at Wichita State University are expected to uphold high academic standards. WSU will not tolerate a lack of academic integrity. Students are responsible for knowing and following the Student Code of Conduct <a href="http://webs.wichita.edu/inaudit/ch8_05.htm">http://webs.wichita.edu/inaudit/ch8_05.htm</a> and the Student Academic Honesty policy <a href="http://webs.wichita.edu/inaudit/ch2_17.htm">http://webs.wichita.edu/inaudit/ch2_17.htm</a> When the faculty member determines sanctions are warranted for violations of academic integrity, regardless of severity, the faculty member must report the infraction to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. If you need more information about the process or wish to appeal a decision, please visit <a href="https://www.wichita.edu/about/student_conduct/ai.php">https://www.wichita.edu/about/student_conduct/ai.php</a> My general policy is to void all credit for any assignment or exam with any academic integrity issues. Repeat offenders are subject to dismissal from the course.</p>
<h2 id="course-description">Course Description:</h2>
<p>An introduction to fatigue analysis and mechanics of damage tolerance emphasizing stress analysis oriented fracture mechanics. Includes stress intensity, fracture toughness, residual strength, fatigue crack growth rate, fatigue crack propagation and damage tolerance concepts.</p>
<h2 id="definition-of-a-credit-hour">Definition of a Credit Hour:</h2>
<p>Success in this 3 credit hour course is based on the expectation that students will spend, for each unit of credit, a minimum of 45 hours over the length of the course (normally 3 hours per unit per week with 1 of the hours used for lecture) for instruction and preparation/studying or course related activities for a total of 135 hours.</p>
<h2 id="measurable-student-learning-outcomes">Measurable Student Learning Outcomes:</h2>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate stress intensity factors for a wide variety of geometry and loading conditions</li>
<li>Analyze the residual strength of a damaged structure</li>
<li>Calculate fatigue life and crack propagation</li>
<li>Design structures for damage tolerance</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-textbook">Course Textbook:</h2>
<p>The text used for this class is made up of notes originally assembled by Dr. Bert L. Smith and Dr. Walter J. Horn, which will be prepared by the department.

<h2 id="other-references">Other References:</h2>
<p>The notes used in this course provide a very good base, but sometimes supplemental material is beneficial. The following texts are recommended as additional references:</p>
<ul>
<li>H. Broek, <em>The Practical Use of Fracture Mechanics</em></li>
<li>H.L. Ewalds and R.J.H. Wanhill, <em>Fracture Mechanics</em></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites:</h2>
<p>AE 525 or AE 733.</p>
<h2 id="grading-policy">Grading Policy:</h2>
<p>Homework (10%), Midterm 1 (30%), Midterm 2 (30%), Final Project (30%). Final grades follow a traditional scale of:</p>

<p>Per department policy, final course grades will not be disclosed before the official notifications by the University.</p>
<h2 id="homework">Homework:</h2>
<p>Homework will be submitted online via Blackboard, half the homework credit will be granted for completion. Homework solutions will be posted to Blackboard, and the remaining half of the homework credit will be assigned after you complete (and submit) your self-grade. You do not lose credit for incorrect answers, but your self-grade should explain the differences between your answer and the correct solution. It is anticipated that there will be a total of 9 Homework assignments, each worth 100 points. Tentative homework due dates are given in the course schedule. Late homework will not be accepted.</p>
<h2 id="exams">Exams:</h2>
<p>There will be two major midterm exams during the semester. Exams will be closed-book and closed-notes, but there will be an equation sheet provided. Anticipated exam dates are given in the course schedule.</p>
<h2 id="final-project">Final Project:</h2>
<p>More details on the final project will be given after the first mid-term exam. The final project is intended to serve as a cumulative application of all material used in this course, so be sure that you demonstrate the principles you have learned. In this final project you will be required to perform residual strength, fatigue, and damage tolerance analysis on a real-life part of your choosing. You will use the principles developed in this class to estimate the maximum load your part can carry, a reasonable inspection cycle, etc. The part you choose should undergo cyclic loading of some form for a fatigue analysis. The final project will be due on May 6 by 5:00 pm.</p>
