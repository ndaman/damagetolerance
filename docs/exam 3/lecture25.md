## non-destructive testing methods

-   Visual Methods
-   Radiographic Inspection
-   Ultrasonic Inspection
-   Eddy Current Inspection
-   Magnetic Particle
-   Other Methods

----
## visual inspection

-   Accounts for about 80% of all cracks detected in industry
-   Visual inspection can be assisted with borescopes or liquid penetrant
-   In practice many cracks can be missed during visual inspection

----
## visual detection rate of B-737

----
## liquid penetrants

-   Can be visual dye or fluorescent dye (viewed under black light)
-   Penetrant is applied to surface
-   Developer then enhances visibility of penetrant (blooming effect)
-   Can detect cracks as small as 0.05 inches

----
## disadvantages of liquid penetrants

-   Can only detect surface anomalies
-   Surface must be fairly smooth
-   Chemical compatibility of penetrant and structure
-   relatively slow (surface prep, application, inspection)

----
## radiographic inspection

-   X-rays (most common), Gamma rays can also be used
-   Easist to detect when major flaw dimension is parallel to X-ray beam
-   Three main types
    1.  Film radiography - image stored on film for later viewing
    2.  Real time radiography - image viewed and manipulated in real time
    3.  Computed Tomography (CT) - 3D X-rays computed from multiple sections

----
## radiographic inspection

-   Size of crack that can be detected depends on scan resolution
-   Trade-off betwen total image size and resolution
-   Can detect internal flaws
-   However, the exact location of an internal flaw is difficult to obtain
-   Need access to both sides of structure

----
## ultrasonic inspection

-   High frequency sound waves
-   Can determine presence of flaw and its location through thickness
-   Best detects flaws with major axis perpendicular to sound beam
-   Immersion testing is often used to facilitate ultrasonic inspection

----
## ultrasonic inspection

----
## eddy current inspection

-   Generates small electrical currents using an electromagnet
-   Can only be used in materials that are electrical conductors
-   Otherwise more broadly applicable than Radiography and ultrasonic
-   More sensitive to flaws perpendicular to current flow direction (similar to ultrasonic)

----
## magnetic particle

-   limited to ferromagnetic materials
-   better for small parts (need to generate large electric current for large materials)
-   some objects will need to be demagnetized after test
-   surface/near surface defects

----
## acoustic emissions

-   accelerometers at multiple sources can measure response to acoustic emission
-   response will vary between pristine and un-damaged material
-   cannot always detect location of damage

----
## thermal inspection

-   flaws will also alter thermal conductivity
-   thermal source with infrared camera can detect flaws

---
# structural health monitoring

----
## continuous monitoring

-   Inspections for damage are often performed at regular intervals
-   What if there was damage caused by an unexpected overload between inspection intervals?
-   A lot of research is being done to efficiently and continuously monitor critical structureâ€™s health

----
## structural health monitoring

-   Structural health monitoring often uses accelerometers, strain gauges, together with data processing
-   Detailed record of load history can also be used to infer damage and trigger an inspection
