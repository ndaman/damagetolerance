composites
==========

<span>failure modes</span>

-   Because composite materials are heterogeneous there are several failure modes to consider

-   Fiber breakage

-   Matrix cracking

-   Fiber-matrix de-bonding

-   Ply delamination

<span>fatigue in composites</span>

-   In metals, cracks are most likely to form near the surface or a stress concentration (hole, notch, etc.)

-   In composites, internal variability and voids can give rise to sub-surface cracks

-   The ideal combination for fatigue performance is a very stiff fiber (reduces strain in the matrix) and a very tough matrix

<span>cracks in a composite</span>

<span>fiber orientation</span>

-   It is intuitive that in tensile fatigue, a composite with fibers aligned in the direction of tension will have the best performance

-   At high-cycle fatigue, however, a slight mis-orientation can improve fatigue performance

-   Straight roving also has better fatigue performance than woven roving

<span>orientation</span>

<span>free edge effects</span>

-   In practice, composites are often over-designed for in-plane loading

-   Problems occur during un-expected out-of-plane loading

-   This can occur near the free edge of a laminate

<span>free edge effects</span>

-   Composite laminate theory was developed under an assumption of plane stress

-   This is fairly accurate sufficiently far away from geometric discontinuities, such as free edges

-   At a free edge, in-plane shear stresses must be zero

-   To satisfy equilibrium the out-of-plane shear stress increases to match
    *σ*<sub>11, 1</sub> + *σ*<sub>12, 2</sub> + *σ*<sub>13, 3</sub> = 0

<span>free edge effects</span>

<span>stacking sequence</span>

-   The free edge effect is proportional to the effective lamina thickness

-   It can be minimized by not stacking layers of the same orientation directly on top of each other

-   There is also a normal stress in *σ*<sub>*z*</sub> that develops

-   This normal stress can be either tensile or compressive depending on the stacking sequence

<span>interlaminar strengthening</span>

-   There are several techniques to improve the inter-laminar performance of composites near the free edge

-   Stitching

-   Braiding

-   Z-Pinning

-   Edge Cap

-   Toughened inter-laminar adhesive sheet

<span>open hole compression</span>

-   One of the first tests of a composite’s damage tolerance is known as open hole compression

-   A specimen is drilled with a hole and then put in a fixture which prevents buckling under compression

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1gHxCt-qv0>

-   Meant to give a measure of a composite after being “damaged” by a hole

-   While a hole is a very repeatable form of damage, it is not representative of all damage

<span>compression after impact</span>

-   Another test was developed to measure the strength of a composite after undergoing impact damage

-   Various levels of impact damage can be applied, but most commonly “barely visible impact damage” is used

-   After impacting the specimen, it is tested in a compression fixture to prevent buckling

<span>ceramic matrix composites</span>

-   Ceramics are very strong and stiff, with very good performance at elevated temperature

-   They are very weak in tension, however, and are very susceptible to damage

-   Adding ceramic fibers helps to

    -   Reduce stress in the matrix, increase the stress required to propagate crack

    -   When cracks do form, the cracks bridge without fracture

corrosion
=========

<span>corrosion</span>

-   Corrosion can be difficult to accelerate in a lab (like fatigue), and so is not as well-understood

-   There are several general categories of corrosion

-   General corrosion - occurs equally and globally

-   Localized corrosion - occurs at specific locations

-   Metallurgically influenced corrosion - grain boundaries, dealloying

-   Mechanically assisted degradation

-   Environmentally induced cracking

<span>general corrosion</span>

-   Atmospheric corrosion

-   Galvanic corrosion (dissimilar metals in contact)

<span>localized corrosion</span>

-   Similar to general corrosion, but localized

-   Can accelerate the development of fatigue cracks

-   Pitting

<span>metallurgical corrosion</span>

-   Different concentrations of alloy constituents at grain boundaries

-   Galvanic corrosion at a grain boundary could be possible

-   Exfoliation is a form of this that can occur in aluminum alloys with elongated grains parallel to the surface

-   Fasteners with dissimilar materials can also cause metallurgical corrosion

<span>mechanically assisted degradation</span>

-   Chemical effects combined with mechanical stress

-   Fretting corrosion (abrasive corrosion particles, like oxides, trapped can lead to more corrosion)

-   Corrosion fatigue

<span>environmentally induced cracking</span>

-   stress corrosion cracking

-   hydrogen damage, embrittlement

aging
=====

<span>aging</span>

-   Aging is a term often used to describe the degradation of polymers

-   Most polymers are not “pure” but contain some fraction of additives to modify the properties

-   Commonly they will have a “plasticizer” which lowers the glass transition temperature

-   As these plasticizers degrade, the polymer becomes more brittle

non-destructive testing
=======================

<span>non-destructive evaluation/testing</span>

-   Visual

-   Radiographic

-   Ultrasonic

-   Magnetic particle

-   Acoustic Emission

-   Thermal Inspection

-   Optical Techniques

<span>visual</span>

-   Liquid penetrant

-   Borescopes

-   Only detect surface damage

-   False positives in corners and complex shapes

<span>radiographic</span>

-   X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons

-   Can detect internal cracks/damage

-   Need two-sided access to test piece

-   Sensitive to flaw orientation

-   Expensive, can be difficult to locate flaw precisely

<span>ultrasonic</span>

-   Uses ultrasonic sound waves through a part to detect damage

-   Only one-sided access is needed

-   Rough surfaces can be problematic, needing a couplant

-   Very sensitive to damage orientation

-   Difficult to inspect large surfaces

<span>eddy current</span>

-   Small electrical currents from electromagnetic coil

-   Sensitive to many metallurgical variables - can be tuned for specific purposes

-   Relatively fast technique

-   Test object must be electrically conductive

-   Limited depth penetration

<span>magnetic particle</span>

-   Only for ferromagnetic materials

-   Material is magnetized and particles are used to detect anomalies

-   Relatively inexpensive

-   Complex parts can be easily inspected

-   Large current needed to magnetize large parts

<span>acoustic emissions</span>

-   Load a specimen and measure the acoustic response (“transient elastic stress wave generated from a localized source whtin a material”)

-   Popular in composites and concrete

-   Location can be found via triangulation, but the size of damage is not readily found

-   Large areas can be monitored with only a few sensors, can be monitored during use

-   Not strictly “nde” since it detects damage as it occurs or grows

-   Emmisions are fairly unique to a given structure

<span>thermal inspection</span>

-   Heat (or cool) test object and look for anomalies

-   Non-contact method, wide field of view

-   Difficult to uniformly heat an object

-   Not all flaws will disrupt heat flow

<span>optical techniques</span>

-   Optical interference - optical flat along surface to detect surface anomalies

-   Holography - three-dimensional virtual images as structure is loaded

-   Moire - visualize strain field using fringe patterns
