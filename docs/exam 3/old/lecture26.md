<span>non-destructive testing methods</span>

-   Visual Methods

-   Radiographic Inspection

-   Ultrasonic Inspection

-   Eddy Current Inspection

-   Magnetic Particle

-   Other Methods

<span>visual inspection</span>

-   Accounts for about 80% of all cracks detected in industry

-   Visual inspection can be assisted with borescopes or liquid penetrant

-   In practice many cracks can be missed during visual inspection

<span>visual detection rate of B-737</span>

<span>liquid penetrants</span>

-   Can be visual dye or fluorescent dye (viewed under black light)

-   Penetrant is applied to surface

-   Developer then enhances visibility of penetrant (blooming effect)

-   Can detect cracks as small as 0.05 inches

<span>disadvantages of liquid penetrants</span>

-   Can only detect surface anomalies

-   Surface must be fairly smooth

-   Chemical compatibility of penetrant and structure

-   relatively slow (surface prep, application, inspection)

<span>radiographic inspection</span>

-   X-rays (most common), Gamma rays can also be used

-   Easist to detect when major flaw dimension is parallel to X-ray beam

-   Three main types

    1.  Film radiography - image stored on film for later viewing

    2.  Real time radiography - image viewed and manipulated in real time

    3.  Computed Tomography (CT) - 3D X-rays computed from multiple sections

<span>radiographic inspection</span>

-   Size of crack that can be detected depends on scan resolution

-   Trade-off betwen total image size and resolution

-   Can detect internal flaws

-   However, the exact location of an internal flaw is difficult to obtain

-   Need access to both sides of structure

<span>ultrasonic inspection</span>

-   High frequency sound waves

-   Can determine presence of flaw and its location through thickness

-   Best detects flaws with major axis perpendicular to sound beam

-   Immersion testing is often used to facilitate ultrasonic inspection

<span>ultrasonic inspection</span>

<span>eddy current inspection</span>

-   Generates small electrical currents using an electromagnet

-   Can only be used in materials that are electrical conductors

-   Otherwise more broadly applicable than Radiography and ultrasonic

-   More sensitive to flaws perpendicular to current flow direction (similar to ultrasonic)

<span>magnetic particle</span>

-   limited to ferromagnetic materials

-   better for small parts (need to generate large electric current for large materials)

-   some objects will need to be demagnetized after test

-   surface/near surface defects

<span>acoustic emissions</span>

-   accelerometers at multiple sources can measure response to acoustic emission

-   response will vary between pristine and un-damaged material

-   cannot always detect location of damage

<span>thermal inspection</span>

-   flaws will also alter thermal conductivity

-   thermal source with infrared camera can detect flaws

structural health monitoring
============================

<span>continuous monitoring</span>

-   Inspections for damage are often performed at regular intervals

-   What if there was damage caused by an unexpected overload between inspection intervals?

-   A lot of research is being done to efficiently and continuously monitor critical structureâ€™s health

<span>structural health monitoring</span>

-   Structural health monitoring often uses accelerometers, strain gauges, together with data processing

-   Detailed record of load history can also be used to infer damage and trigger an inspection
