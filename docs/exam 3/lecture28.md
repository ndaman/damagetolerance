## elasticity

- In solving elasticity problems, we generally need to satisfy three things
1. Boundary conditions
2. Equilibrium
3. Strain Compatibility

----
## boundary conditions 

- To express boundary conditions in terms of stress, we use a vector representation of stress called "traction"
- Cauchy's stress theory can be used to relate the stress tensor to a traction vector at some surface
- More on traction [here](https://ndaman.github.io/elasticity/exam%202/lecture8.html)

----
## equilibrium

- We have used equilibrium in Statics and Mechanics of Materials, but it is convenient to express it in terms of stress
- See [here](https://ndaman.github.io/elasticity/exam%202/lecture10.html) for discussion of equilibrium
