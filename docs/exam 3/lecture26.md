  <li> Sometimes composites hurt more than they help when not utilized properly </li>
  </div>

----
## fracture

- DCB testing of 3D-printed composites

----
## nozzle design

- Influence flow to (mis)-orient fibers
- print "black aluminum"

----
## optimize print path

- If we know the composite properties and the use case, can we design a print path to take advantage

----
## thermoplastic welding

- Thermoplastic composites
- simulate induction welding of joints

---
# corrosion

----
## corrosion

-   Corrosion can be difficult to accelerate in a lab (like fatigue), and so is not as well-understood
-   There are several general categories of corrosion
-   General corrosion - occurs equally and globally
-   Localized corrosion - occurs at specific locations
-   Metallurgically influenced corrosion - grain boundaries, dealloying
-   Mechanically assisted degradation
-   Environmentally induced cracking

----
## general corrosion

-   Atmospheric corrosion
-   Galvanic corrosion (dissimilar metals in contact)

----
## localized corrosion

-   Similar to general corrosion, but localized
-   Can accelerate the development of fatigue cracks
-   Pitting

----
## metallurgical corrosion

-   Different concentrations of alloy constituents at grain boundaries
-   Galvanic corrosion at a grain boundary could be possible
-   Exfoliation is a form of this that can occur in aluminum alloys with elongated grains parallel to the surface
-   Fasteners with dissimilar materials can also cause metallurgical corrosion

----
## mechanically assisted degradation

-   Chemical effects combined with mechanical stress
-   Fretting corrosion (abrasive corrosion particles, like oxides, trapped can lead to more corrosion)
-   Corrosion fatigue

----
## environmentally induced cracking

-   stress corrosion cracking
-   hydrogen damage, embrittlement

---
# aging

----
## aging

-   Aging is a term often used to describe the degradation of polymers
-   Most polymers are not “pure” but contain some fraction of additives to modify the properties
-   Commonly they will have a “plasticizer” which lowers the glass transition temperature
-   As these plasticizers degrade, the polymer becomes more brittle
